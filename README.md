# vigrep
Grep for the LabVIEW binary file format.  Searches for string constants, labels, Call Library Nodes, names of Called VI's, etc.

# Usage

    pip install vigrep
    vigrep PATTERN DIRECTORY
    
Currently vigrep only does exact string matches and always recursively searches directories.

# Contributing

Feel free to post PRs to improve this.  This currently does the bare minimum I want of it.
